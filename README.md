> Daemon connecting the [PingBoard](https://github.com/PingTechGmbH/PingBoard) to [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)

![](pingboard.jpeg)

A daemon that connects to a [PingBoard](https://github.com/PingTechGmbH/PingBoard) (or similar macro keyboard), then sends key presses and accepts configuration via [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
The main goal is to enable the PingBoard as an IoT input device and execute actions outside the USB host.
